In spring of 2020 a friend put together a group to play the social deduction game werewolf via Discord. We played so regularly over the course of the pandemic that we invented new roles in the game to keep things interested. On a whim, for a few games I tracked what happened in a spreadsheet to see if I could make something fun with the data.

Recently, I converted the spreadsheet to a relational database in Microsoft Access and wrote a Python program to assess what the best roles are based on that data using a loosey goosey Elo system.
